Message retention and Dead Letter queue
    When a message is moved to a dead letter queue, the enqueue timestamp remains unchanged
    It is recommended that the message retention period of dead letter queue should be longer than the retention period of the original queue

    A message is moved to a DLQ after the maxReceiveCount for a message exceeds.
    This is mentioned in the redrive policy of the source queue
